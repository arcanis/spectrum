Spectrum
========

In a lost corner in the infinite expanse of outer space, a threat powerful enough to destroy life as we know it is gaining momentum and only you can stop it! Destroy your enemies, merge their powers together and use their abilities against them in order to defeat the relentless horde and save the galaxy! Only by harnessing the power of light and color and by outwitting and outmaneuvering your rivals can you hope to survive.

This game mixes a traditional shoot ‘em up genre with color-combining gameplay. Kill enemies and absorb their powerups to acquire new colors and competences. Then use those colors to take down the target core.

This game is using the Microsoft XNA 4.0 Game Engine.
